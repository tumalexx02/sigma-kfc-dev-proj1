# Frontend

To run the frontend part of the application locally, follow these steps:
1. Install Node.js, following this instruction:

2. Open the terminal and go to the frontend directory where your work will be stored.

3. In the terminal, run the command: 

```bash
npm install
```

4. Then, while still in the frontend directory, run the command: npm run dev.

```bash
npm run dev
```

After completing these steps, do not close the terminal. The address where the running frontend will be available will appear in it.
